                        My name is Lee Collins, a full stack web developer with experience in JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and more. I've been fascinated with technology since I was a young boy. The town I grew up in was small, so I decided to move to Dallas, TX in pursuit of a new career. I've dabbled in computer networking and hardware, but found my calling when I made "Hello World" appear on the computer screen.

                        I'm always looking for a new challenege, and I love learning about new technologies and innovations. I'm always looking for the next project to build.
